* Idiom & Purpose
This is the smallest full-featued static site generator that I feel
comfortable using. Everything that is supposed to be copied to the
server goes in ~pages/~, everything else in the root helps pandoc
generate.
* Features
- [X] Simple css: put overrides in ~addenda.css~, leave ~simple.css~
  untouched; it is our baseline taken from the simplecss project
- [X] SimpleCSS compatabile Template
- [ ] [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40993488/convert-markdown-links-to-html-with-pandoc][Link Rewriting]] (from ~.md~ or ~.org~ to ~.html~) with [[https://github.com/wlupton/pandoc-lua-logging][logging]]
- [ ] Get ~<nav>~ section of template working properly
- [ ] Equations
- [ ] BibTeX
- [ ] deploy command
- [ ] Theorem Environments
* Reconstruction
1. simple.css from simplecss project
2. Default pandoc html5 template
   ~pandoc -D html5 > simple.html5~
3. Delete some stuff
